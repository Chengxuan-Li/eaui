# Product UI Experiment

A standalone experiment for a coherent EnergyAtlas urban/building energy-modeling product UI. The repository is [Energy-Atlas/energyatlas-ui](https://github.com/Energy-Atlas/energyatlas-ui) and publishes to <https://energy-atlas.github.io/energyatlas-ui/> ([decision 0017](docs/decisions/0017-github-pages-deployment.md)); the local working folder is still `eaui`, and the final product name is not yet decided. This is separate from `json-render-playground`.

## Status

2026-09-18: an agentic presentation demo. A browser-only workbench takes four fictional districts through a 12-stage workflow with docked panels, map, table, dashboard, roadmap, and creators, and a language model drives its presentation, styling, and layout through the same operations a person uses ([decision 0020](docs/decisions/0020-agentic-presentation-demo.md)). There is no backend: the model is reached through the development server, which holds the key, so the published site has no route to one and stays on the scripted agent. New contributors start with the [developer guide](docs/developer-guide.md).

Accepted decisions: web-only React + TypeScript + Vite ([0002](docs/decisions/0002-web-react-typescript-vite.md)); a combined shell ([0003](docs/decisions/0003-combined-product-shell.md)) in a docking workbench layout ([0004](docs/decisions/0004-workbench-layout-and-docking.md)) with a 12-stage default workflow ([0005](docs/decisions/0005-first-slice-workflow-and-panel-scope.md)) and a scripted agent ([0006](docs/decisions/0006-scripted-agent-and-layout-details.md)); packages ([0007](docs/decisions/0007-package-selection.md)) with FlexLayout for docking ([0008](docs/decisions/0008-flexlayout-docking.md)). The reference audit and package spikes are recorded in `docs/`.

Core workflows must remain useful without an LLM. Favor explicit state, revisitable workflows, progressive disclosure, desktop information density, keyboard access, and traceable changes/results. Identify mocks clearly.

## Setup and commands

Requires Node.js 24 LTS (22.12 or newer works) and npm. Browser tests use the locally installed Microsoft Edge by default; on machines without Edge, run `npx playwright install chromium` and set `PLAYWRIGHT_CHANNEL=chromium`.

```powershell
npm ci                 # install the exact locked dependencies
npm run dev            # start the Vite dev server
npm run build          # typecheck, then build to dist/
npm run preview        # serve the built bundle
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run format:check   # npm run format rewrites files
npm test               # Vitest unit and component tests
npm run test:e2e       # Playwright + axe; starts the dev server on 127.0.0.1:5173
```

Package spikes: run `npm run dev` and open `/?spike=` with `map`, `chart`, `grid`, `flow`, or `flexlayout`.

Before committing, also run `git status --short --branch`, `git diff --check`, and `git diff --cached`.

`.env.example` is the tracked configuration template; `.env.local` is its ignored local counterpart. It lists `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL`, and an optional `OPENAI_BASE_URL`. The **development server** reads them in Node and proxies `/api/llm` for the browser ([decision 0020](docs/decisions/0020-agentic-presentation-demo.md)), so the key never enters the bundle; a built bundle has no such route and falls back to the scripted agent. Never expose keys through `VITE_`-prefixed variables, which Vite bundles into client code. On another machine, create the local counterpart if absent:

```powershell
if (-not (Test-Path .env.local)) { Copy-Item .env.example .env.local }
git check-ignore .env.local
```

Before any credential-bearing integration, document its exact variable names, add safe placeholders to the template, and let the user populate local values. Never put private keys in browser-exposed configuration.
